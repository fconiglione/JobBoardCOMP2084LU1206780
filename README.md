# JobBoardCOMP2084LU1206780

The purpose of my project JobBoardCOMP2084LU1206780 is to generate a job board for both employers and employees. The application allows for the posting of different jobs from different companies.
Each company has the following attributes: name, location, and industry. On the other hand, job postings have: title, description, salary, and company. Eventually, the application should have the 
ability to have two different UIs: one for the employer, and one for the employee - each with different, respective features.
